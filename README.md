TASK DESCRIPTION : This Sentiment Analysis project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify textual data such as tweets or reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Developed in Python using tools like NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Pandas, the project follows a complete ML pipelineâ€”from data loading and text preprocessing (including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization) to model training and evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The dataset used is the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset, which contains labeled tweets expressing customer opinions toward airlines. The project includes exploratory data analysis, visualization of sentiment distribution, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The code is written in a modular, well-documented format and executed in an IDE like PyCharm or VS Code. The final model can predict the sentiment of unseen text input, demonstrating the practical application of NLP in real-world opinion mining tasks. This project showcases the integration of data science, machine learning, and textual analytics for deriving actionable insights from raw text data.
